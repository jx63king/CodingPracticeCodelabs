Given two strings, base and remove, return a version of the base string where all instances of the remove string have been removed (not case sensitive). You may assume that the remove string is length 1 or more. Remove only non-overlapping instances, so with "xxx" removing "xx" leaves "x".


withoutString("Hello there", "llo") → "He there"
withoutString("Hello there", "e") → "Hllo thr"
withoutString("Hello there", "x") → "Hello there"

my thoughts: 
1) check the base string and see if the substring exist 
2) if it exist, replace the substring with ""

//the following version is not taking care of the upper case and lower case 
public String withoutString(String base, String remove) {
    return base.replace(remove, ""); 
  
}

// the following is working which I wrote 
public String withoutString(String base, String remove) {
    base = base.replace(remove, ""); 
    remove = remove.toLowerCase(); 
    base = base.replace(remove, ""); 
    remove = remove.toUpperCase(); 
    base = base.replace(remove, ""); 

    return base; 
  
}
